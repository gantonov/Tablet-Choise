Restaurant e-menu
=============
Python course project, FMI, Sofia University
--------------------------------------------

Restaurant e-menu will be a system for electronic orders in restaurants. 
It will include mobile app, which will be installed on tablets that will be given to the customers to order, admin page for managing the menu, client app for the bar and the kitchen and server.
I'll develop only the administration part for the Python course.
For the frontend of the administration I'm using ExtJS.

Features:
 * Log in system
 * Add/edit/delete category
 * Add/edit/delete item
 * Add/edit/delete users with different user roles: administrator, waiter ...

 * Orders - when an order is made an notifcation will be sent to the kitchen and to the bar.
 * When the order is delivered to the table, the waiter checks that it is delivered 
 * The administrator can add, edit and delete items on the menu

Additional features that might be imlemented:
 * Voting for menu items
 * Comments for the menu items
