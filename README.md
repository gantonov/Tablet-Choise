Tablet Choise
=============
Python course project, FMI, Sofia University
--------------------------------------------

Tablet Choise will be a system for electronic orders in restaurants. 
It will include mobile app, which will be installed on tablets that will be given to the customers to order, admin page for managing the menu, client app for the bar and the kitchen and server.
I'll develop only the server part for the Python course and will use simple web forms for testing. 

Features:
 * Log in system
 * Orders - when an order is made an notifcation will be sent to the kitchen and to the bar.
 * When the order is delivered to the table, the waiter checks that it is delivered 
 * The administrator can add, edit and delete items on the menu

Additional features that might be imlemented:
 * Voting for menu items
 * Comments for the menu items
